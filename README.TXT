1. OVERVIEW

Pandora is a free peer-to-peer (P2P) social network application.
It affords functions of instant messenger, audio and video chat, trading
platform, commercial system, payment system, distributed development
system, file exchange and vote system. Pandora has its own binary protocol,
uses a cryptography and a web of trust.

Pandora is not yet another "geek thing". It is designed for ordinary people,
has a graphical user interface (GUI) and works "out of the box".

The concept of Pandora is described in the article:
https://github.com/Novator/Pandora/wiki/P2P-social-network-Pandora

See the user manual with pictures in wiki to quick start:

  brew update
  brew doctor
  brew install ruby
  brew install rbenv

Download and unpack master.zip (see the next chapter), run pandora.sh.


7. MANUAL INSTALLATION OR UPDATE

7.1. Download the archive and unpack it:

  https://github.com/Novator/Pandora/archive/master.zip

7.2. Install needed packages if they still are not installed:

  ruby, ruby-sqlite3, ruby-gtk2, openssl, unzip, ruby-ncurses, ruby-gstreamer,
  gstreamer0.10-x, gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg, gstreamer0.10-plugins-good, gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad

7.3. Set executable rights:

  chmod +x ./pandora.sh

7.4. Copy shortcut to desktop with root and edit paths inside:

  cp ./view/pandora.desktop /usr/share/applications/
  nano /usr/share/applications/pandora.desktop

Pandora can update itself by user click to button on status bar.


8. CONSOLE USER INTERFACE

By default Pandora launches Gtk2 graphical user interface,
but you can order it to run Ncurses console user interface:

  ./pandora.sh -c   -- this is Curses/Ncurses mode
  ./pandora.sh -s   -- run via screen or return to session
  ./util/pancurse.sh      -- run or return screen session
  ./util/pancurse.sh -d   -- run via screen like a daemon

Console interface can be useful on Raspberri Pi, dedicated or
virtual servers when you want to have your own permanent node.

Attention: CUI has pared-down functionality in comparison with GUI.
It is recommended to setup all preferences in GUI mode on desktop
computer, then move ./base/pandora.sqlite to remote computer.
