Description: P2P social network Pandora
 Pandora is a free peer-to-peer (P2P) social network application.
 It affords functions of instant messenger, audio and video chat, commercial
 system, distributed development system, file exchange and vote system.
 ---
 Pandora has its own binary protocol and uses cryptography and trust networks.
 Pandora is not yet another "geek thing". It is designed for ordinary people,
 has a graphical user interface (GUI) and works "out of the box".
